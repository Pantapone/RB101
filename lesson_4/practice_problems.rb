#1
# -> [1, 2, 3] because hi is evaluated to "true", thus all elements of the array are returned

#2
# count counts how many elements in the array evaluate to "true" and returns the number of the times

#3 
# it returns an array for all the elements of the array which evaluate to "false"; as "puts num" evaluates to nil (which is not "truthy") [1, 2, 3] is returned in a new array

#4
# new hash: {"a" => "ant, ..."}

#5
# removes the first key, value pair

#6
# 11
# pop returns the last element (caterpillar), while size gives the number of letters -> 1

#7
# the return value is the last expression (num.odd?) -> true ; any? will also return ture

#8
# returns the first specified elements form an array (aka here: 2) -> [1, 2] - it's not destructive 

#9
# [nil, "bear"] -> returns an array, nil as "ant" evaluates to false and that is not returned but the array returned is the same size as the original collection

#10
#[1, nil, nil] (nil because the if statement is true for the array value at index 1 & 2 and puts num always evaluates to nil)
